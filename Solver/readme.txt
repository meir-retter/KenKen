README:

- Solves a KenKen puzzle, printing the output in a grid

- KenKenSolver.java holds the main class

- GL is a library of general functions that I wrote that I'm using for the project

- Make sure any text files you'd like to use are in the correct folder

- The 9x9 takes ~16 seconds to run. Keep in mind that other puzzles of the same size may take significantly
  longer or shorter to solve

- The smaller ones finish almost instantaneously

- The 4x4 example KenKen puzzle given by Lab Instructor Snow is KenKen1961.txt

- I also included a 6x6 (KenKen6x6.txt), an 8x8 (KenKen42367.txt), and a 9x9 (KenKen37292.txt)

- If you'd like to test a different file, make sure it's in the correct format and in the right folder,
  and enter its title as a command line argument. Make sure it's the first command line argument.

- the text file should contain only numbers and operators, in the correct format
